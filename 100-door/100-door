/*
Looking at “100 doors” we can make the following observations:
-There are doors numbered 1 through 100 that start closed. We need to find all the numbers of the open doors at the end of the function, returned in an array.
--We will iterate over the range 100 times, toggling the doors open/closed (represented by true/false)
Each iteration over the range the gap between toggles increases by a multiple, incremented by one.
-On the last iteration only the 100th door will be toggled.
*/

// Create an array of 100 boolean values
// Create a counter starting at 1 that increments once with each iteration
// While the counter is less than or equal to the number of doors carry out the following:
// Keep track of the array index you are accessing, starting at the counter number.
// Create another loop that iterates over the number of doors
// For each index that it lands on, change the boolean value to the opposite of what it was
// Increment the index by the counter number
// Create an empty array and a variable to keep track of our current arrays index
// Map over array of boolean arrays, incrementing index counter after each loop
// When index value == true, push the index into the index array
// Return the array of index numbers
